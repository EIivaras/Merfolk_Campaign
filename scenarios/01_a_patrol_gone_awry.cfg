			story= _ "The year is 630 YW. Three years have passed since the events of Eastern Invasion and Dead Water sent the land into turmoil. While Mal-Ravanal and his cabal of liches have been turned back from the gates of Weldyn, Wesnoth has yet to recover from the destruction that was wrought upon it in the wake of the invasion. Stray groups of undead still wander at night, and though they now serve lesser masters, that is of little comfort to those whose loved ones are beset by them."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story= _ "In the previous years, with a focus on rebuilding Wesnoth, it is understandable that no one had heard of a recently established merfolk city. During the Eastern Invasion, a migrating merfolk populace settled a small bay on the Shimmering Isle that came to house what would be known as the city of Elefas."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story= _ "Shortly after its establishment the Kai was gravely injured on a hunting trip, succumbing to his injuries shortly after. Leadership of Elefas and its people fell to his only child and beloved daughter - Kai Danielle."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story= _ "With the help of her advisor, [SupportingCharacter2], the next couple years ran smoothly. Danielle slowly learned more and more about what it was like to govern a growing merfolk metropolis."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story= _ "Still, there was much she had yet to experience. On the 21st day of the sixth month of the year 630 YW, she met up with the captain of the guard. She was going to join [SupportingCharacter1] and his retinue on a patrol to the nearby outposts, seeing the route for herself and boosting the morale of the troops stationed within them."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_ "The trip, however, proved to be ill-fated. A dense fog settled on the ocean surrounding the bay Elefas was situated in, and alongside this, troubling reports were circulating between several of the outposts..."
